This repo has created to show basics of NumPy and pandas libraries and Visualization with Matplotlib.

#### NumPy
* NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. 

#### pandas
* pandas is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on its way towards this goal.

#### Visualization with Matplotlib.
Visualizing the dataframe obtained with the pandas library.
